# Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository is designed for educational purposes, specifically for those approaching this topic without prior knowledge. Feel free to contribute your notes, insights, and improvements to help enhance the learning experience for others, just please follow the _Code of Conduct_.

Here's a small spoiler I'd like to share with you:

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Before diving in, take a moment to clarify your goals and understand what you're about to learn. Let me give you an example to illustrate my point: your interest in Machine Learning likely stems from tools like ChatGPT or, more broadly, the recent applications of artificial intelligence. 
>
> You might think you can jump straight into creating something similar by simply linking an API to a pre-existing model. Technically, that would workâ€”but that's not really Machine Learning. Rather, it's the result of years of groundbreaking research in the field of Machine Learning.
>
> At its core, Machine Learning is much closer to mathematics and data science than to the end-user implementations we often see. It's about mastering the foundations and building a deep understanding of how data and algorithms work together, not just leveraging the outcomes of others' research. 

### Mindmap

Below, you'll find a conceptual map I've created to highlight the key concepts you absolutely need to understand in order to grasp this topic. Machine Learning isn't inherently very difficult, but it's crucial to have a clear understanding of what we're talking about.
